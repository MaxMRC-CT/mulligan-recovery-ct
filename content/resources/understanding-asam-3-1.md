Choosing the right treatment setting can feel overwhelming. ASAM Level 3.1 is designed for people who need **consistent recovery structure** and a sober environment without intensive medical monitoring.

## What this level typically includes

- A stable residential setting
- Scheduled counseling and recovery groups
- Life-skills and relapse-prevention planning
- Coordination with outpatient or community care providers

## Who may benefit

ASAM 3.1 may be appropriate for adults who are medically stable but need daily accountability and support while building independent routines.

## Why transitions matter

A strong discharge and follow-up plan is often the difference between short-term progress and long-term stability. Families and referral partners can play a major role when communication is clear.

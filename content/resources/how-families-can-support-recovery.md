Family members often carry stress, uncertainty, and hope all at once. Sustainable support starts with clear roles and practical expectations.

## Helpful approaches

- Focus on consistent, calm communication
- Set boundaries you can maintain
- Attend education or support groups when available
- Celebrate progress, not perfection
